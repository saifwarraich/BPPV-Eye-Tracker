# BPPV - Eye Tracker ðŸ’¡

## Overview

This project focuses on capturing videos along with head positions for analyzing Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). The application is a desktop-based solution built to process and analyze data from vertigo glasses in real time or offline, with annotation and editing functionalities.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Built using **Electron JS** and **React JS** for a interactive user interface.
- **Video Processing**: Utilizes the **Pupil-UVC library** and **FFmpeg** in Python for efficient handling and processing of video streams.

## Prerequisites

### Node.js Version

This project requires Node.js version `v20.7.0`. Please ensure you have this version installed. If you're using [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can switch to the correct version by running:

```bash
nvm use
```

If you haven't installed this Node version yet, you can do so with:

```bash
nvm install v20.7.0
```

### Pyhton Version

This project requires Python version `Python 3.10.12`. Please ensure you have this version installed.

## Hardware Used

### Vertigo Glasses

The application is specifically designed to interface with Pupil Labsâ€™ Vertigo Glasses, a sophisticated device that captures high-quality eye-tracking and head-movement data. These glasses provide the foundation for analyzing eye movement patterns and diagnosing vertigo triggers, making them integral to the project.

## Python Module Details

### Purpose

The Python module in this project acts as the interface between the desktop application and the Vertigo Glasses. Its primary functions include:

1- Capturing Data: Establishing a connection with the glasses to retrieve real-time video streams of eye movements and head positions.
2- Data Conversion: Utilizing tools like FFmpeg to convert video codecs from the format generated by the glasses to formats compatible with the application.
3- Integration: Enabling seamless communication between the glasses and the application, allowing live data analysis, video annotation, and storage for offline usage.
4- The module was developed using libraries provided by Pupil Labs, ensuring accurate and reliable data acquisition.

### Important Commands

- `yarn` to install all the dependencies
- `yarn dev` to run nodemon development server
- `yarn build` to compile typescript code
- `yarn start` to run compiled code
- `yarn lint`: to run eslint
- `yarn prettier-format`: to format the whole code
